\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I am deeply grateful to Mr Fosco Cancelliere for his support while writing this thesis, who acted as a proof reader and guide in this journey. I am greatly thankful to Ms Francesca Galvagno as well, as she stood alongside me and helped me through my most trying times while working on this project and being my support during this year, due to both Covid and non-Covid related hardships.

Special thanks go to my supervisor, Dr Robert G. Belleman, as he allowed me to explore this interesting field with freedom and responsibility, while being of help and support. Alongside him, I want to thank Dr Ana Oprescu for being a guiding and cheerful light during this trying year of University, and although facing an unconventional education, she kept motivating and rooting for us to succeed, boosting the morale of the cohort and people around her in general.

Finally, I want to thank Mr Youri Reijne and Mr Simon Baars for being such good and supporting friends, and such helpful presences throughout the academic year.
