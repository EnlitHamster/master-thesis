\chapter*{Abstract}

Developing VR visualizations is an iterative process that requires the developer to move between workstation and testing area. The usage of Head Mounted Displays that require the user to fully move away from development and immerse themselves into the environment can make the experience tiring and break flow of development. Furthermore, no tools exist to streamline the development of such visualizations, requiring the user to have a set of technical skills that make approaching this world harder.

We present a new architecture for integrating visualization libraries such as VTK with game and simulation engines like Unity, that allows users to have an out-of-the-box integration and development environment, reducing the technical barrier for such development. The architecture tackles both the low level integration of the two softwares, as well as the creation of a UI framework to allow the user to build and interact with visualizations.

Finally, we present the implementation of such an integration that is able to leverage the full potential of the visualization library while achieving the required performances for a VR app, showing that the proposed architecture is capable of supporting an immersive VR environment for the development of VR visualizations which would remove the obstacles and issues of traditional desktop development.
